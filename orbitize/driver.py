class Driver(object):
    """
    Runs through ``orbitize`` methods in a standardized way.

    Args:
        filename (str): path to data file. See ``orbitize.read_input.py``
        sampler (str): algorithm to use for orbit computation. 'PTMCMC' for 
            Markov Chain Monte Carlo, 'OFTI' for Orbits for the Impatient.
        lnlike (str): name of function in ``orbitize.lnlike.py`` that will
            be used to compute likelihood. ["chi2_lnlike"]
        num_secondary_bodies (int): number of secondary bodies in the system. 
            Should be at least 1.
        system_mass (float): mean total mass of the system, in M_sol
        plx (float): mean parallax of the system, in arcsec
        mass_err (float): uncertainty on ``system_mass``, in M_sol
        plx_err (float): uncertainty on ``plx``, in arcsec
