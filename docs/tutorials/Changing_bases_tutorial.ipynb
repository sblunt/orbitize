    "# Fitting in different orbital bases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we show how one can perform orbit-fits in different coordinate bases amongst the ones supported by `orbitize`. Currently fitting in different bases is only supported in MCMC, so we will use MCMC to perform an orbit-fit in an orbital basis distinct from the default one. For a general introduction to MCMC, be sure to check out the [MCMC Introduction tutorial](https://orbitize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/MCMC_tutorial.html) first!"

    "The default way to define an orbit in `orbitize` is through what we call the 'standard basis', which consists of eight parameters: semi-major axis (sma), eccentricity (ecc), inclination (inc), argument of periastron (aop), position angle of the nodes (pan), epoch of periastron expressed as a fraction of the period past a reference epoch (tau), parallax (plx) and total system mass (mtot). Each orbital element has an associated default prior; to see how to explore and modify these priors check out the [Modifying priors tutorial](http://orbitize.info/en/latest/tutorials/Modifying_Priors.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative way to define an orbit is through its position and velocity components in XYZ space for a given epoch; we will call this the 'XYZ basis'. The orbit is thus defined with the array ($x$, $y$, $z$, $\\dot{x}$, $\\dot{y}$,$\\dot{z}$, plx, mtot), with position coordinates measured in AU and velocity components in $\\text{km s}^{-1}$. In this basis, the sky-plane coordinates ($x,y$) are the separations of the planet relative to the primary, with the positive $x$ and $y$ directions coinciding with the positive RA and Dec directions, respectively. The $z$ direction is the line-of-sight coordinate, such that movement in the positive $z$ direction causes a redshift. The default priors are uniform all uniform."
