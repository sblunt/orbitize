    "The `results.py` module contains several plotting functions to visualize the results of your `orbitize` orbit fit. Basic uses of these functions are covered in the [OFTI](https://orbitize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/OFTI_tutorial.html) and [MCMC](https://orbitize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/MCMC_tutorial.html) tutorials. Here, we will examine these plotting functions more deeply. This tutorial will be updated as more features are added to `orbitize`."

These points are then connected by coloured line segments corresponding to the date where the object would be at that point in the orbit.
