orbitize!
=========

Hello world! Welcome to the documentation for ``orbitize``, a Python
package for fitting orbits of directly imaged planets. 

``orbitize`` packages two back-end algorithms into a consistent API. 
It's written to be fast, extensible, and easy-to-use. The tutorials below will walk
you through the code and introduce some technical stuff, but we suggest learning about
the `Orbits for the Impatient (OFTI) algorithm <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017AJ....153..229B/abstract>`_
and MCMC algorithms (we use `this one <http://dfm.io/emcee/current/>`_) before diving in.
Our `contributor guidelines <https://github.com/sblunt/orbitize/blob/master/contributor_guidelines.md>`_
document will point you to more useful resources. 

``orbitize`` is designed to meet the needs of the exoplanet imaging community, and we
encourage community involvement. If you find a bug, want to request a feature, etc. please
create an `issue on GitHub <https://github.com/sblunt/orbitize/issues>`_. 

``orbitize`` is patterned after and inspired by `radvel <https://radvel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
